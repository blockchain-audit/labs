checked by Itty Fishman

in the contract :
The code is structured very nicely and clearly

In the removeBid function, in my opinion, the amount should be reset manually so as not to cause disruption

and when the endAuction function is activated?

test:

 testAddBid()  pass

 testNotAddBid() pass

  testAdd2Bidds() pass 

  testNotAdd2Bidds() pass

  testRemoveBid() pass

  testNotRemoveBid() pass

  testEndAuction() pass

  testEndAuctionNoBidds() pass

  testNotEndAuction() pass

  testEndAuctionNotExist() pass---
