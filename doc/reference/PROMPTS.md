## Framework


**Introduction**

This document outlines five effective prompt frameworks that can be used to enhance the quality of responses generated by ChatGPT. By strategically structuring prompts within these frameworks, you can guide ChatGPT to produce more comprehensive, informative, and creative outputs.

**Frameworks**

1. **R-T-F (Role-Task-Format)**
   - **Act as a** [ROLE]
   - **Create a** [TASK]
   - **Show as** [FORMAT]

   **Example:**

   Act as a Facebook Ad Marketer. Design a compelling Facebook ad campaign to promote a new line of fitness apparel for a sports brand. Create a storyboard outlining the sequence of ad creatives, including ad copy, visuals, and targeting strategy.

2. **T-A-G (Task-Action-Goal)**
   - **Define the** [TASK]
   - **State the** [ACTION]
   - **Clarify the** [GOAL]

   **Example:**

   The task is to evaluate the performance of team members. Act as a direct manager and assess the strengths and weaknesses of team members. Goal is to improve team performance so that the average user satisfaction score moves from 6 to 7.5 in the next quarter.

3. **B-A-B (Before-After-Bridge)**
   - **Explain Problem** [BEFORE]
   - **State Outcome** [AFTER]
   - **Ask for the** [BRIDGE]

   **Example:**

   We're nowhere to be seen on SEO rankings. We want to be in the top 10 SEO ranking in our niche in 90 days. Develop a detailed plan mentioning all the measures we should take, also include a list of top 20 keywords.

4. **C-A-R-E (Context-Action-Result-Example)**
   - **Give the** [CONTEXT]
   - **Describe the** [ACTION]
   - **Clarify the** [RESULT]
   - **Give the** [EXAMPLE]

   **Example:**

   We are launching a new line of sustainable clothing. Can you assist us in creating a targeted advertising campaign that emphasizes our environmental commitment? Our desired outcome is to drive product awareness and sales. A good example of a similar successful initiative is Patagonia's "Don't Buy This Jacket" campaign, which highlighted their commitment to sustainability while enhancing their brand image.

5. **R-I-S-E (Role-Input-Steps-Expectation)**
   - **Specify the** [ROLE]
   - **Describe the** [INPUT]
   - **Ask for** [STEPS]
   - **Describe the** [EXPECTATION]

   **Example:**

   Imagine you are a content strategist. I've gathered detailed information about our target audience, including their interests and common questions related to our industry. Provide a step-by-step content strategy plan identifying key topics based on our audience insights, creating an editorial calendar, and drafting engaging content that aligns with our brand message. Aim to increase our blog's monthly visitors by 40% and enhance our brand's position as a thought leader in our industry.

**Conclusion**

By effectively utilizing these prompt frameworks, you can unlock the full potential of ChatGPT and generate more meaningful and impactful responses tailored to your specific needs.
