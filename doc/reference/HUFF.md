## Stack Manipulation

```
POP     (0x50):         Remove the top item from the stack.
PUSH[x] (0x60 to 0x7f): Pushes a 1 to 32-byte immediate value onto the stack.    [1-32]
DUP [x] (0x80 to 0x8f): Duplicate the nth from the top of the stack and push it  [1-16]
SWAP[x] (0x90 to 0x9f): Swap the top of the stack with the nth item from the top [1-16]
```


## Memory Operations

```
MLOAD   (0x51): Load a 32-byte word from memory.
MSTORE  (0x52): Store a 32-byte word to memory.
MSTORE8 (0x53): Store a single byte to memory.
```

### Mnemonic

```asm
// 1 byte = 8 bits | 32 bytes = 256 bits

PUSH2 0x1000  // VALUE TO STORE
PUSH1 0x00    // POINTER [0]
MSTORE

//00000000000000000000000000000000
//00000000000000000000000000001000

PUSH1 0x05    // VALUE TO STORE
PUSH1 0x20    // POINTER [32]
MSTORE

//00000000000000000000000000000000
//00000000000000000000000000001000
//00000000000000000000000000000000
//00000000000000000000000000000005

PUSH1 0x1F     // VALUE TO STORE
PUSH1 0x40     // POINTER [64]
MSTORE

PUSH1 0x20
