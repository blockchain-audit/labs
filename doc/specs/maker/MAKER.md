## User Stories: Depositors in MakerDAO

**As a depositor in MakerDAO, I want to:**

**Deposit supported crypto assets as collateral to generate Dai:**

* **User Story 1:** I can choose from a list of supported crypto assets to deposit as collateral.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has a web3 wallet compatible with MakerDAO.
    * **Post-conditions:** The chosen asset is transferred from the user's wallet to a designated smart contract, and the corresponding amount of Dai is minted and deposited into the user's wallet.
    * **Accounting:** Collateral amount and corresponding Dai minted are recorded in the system's accounting ledger.
    * **Risk:** The system assesses the risk associated with the deposited asset based on factors like volatility and liquidation ratios.
* **User Story 2:** I can specify the amount of the crypto asset I want to deposit.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has chosen a supported asset.
    * **Post-conditions:** The specified amount of the asset is deducted from the user's wallet, and the corresponding amount of Dai is minted and deposited into the user's wallet.
    * **Accounting:** The specific amount deposited and minted Dai are recorded in the system's accounting ledger.
    * **Risk:** The system calculates the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio based on the deposited amount and its market value to assess the risk of undercollateralization.
* **User Story 3:** I can receive real-time information about the exchange rate between my deposited asset and Dai.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has chosen a supported asset.
    * **Post-conditions:** The user interface displays the current exchange rate and updates it dynamically based on market data.
    * **Accounting:** No direct impact on accounting, but exchange rate is used for calculations.
    * **Risk:** Not directly applicable, but understanding the exchange rate helps users make informed decisions about deposit amounts.

**Redeem interest earned on my deposits:**

* **User Story 4:** I can view the amount of interest accrued on my deposits over time.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has an active deposit.
    * **Post-conditions:** The user interface displays the accumulated interest based on the current stability fee and deposit duration.
    * **Accounting:** Interest earned is calculated and recorded in the system's accounting ledger.
    * **Risk:** Not directly applicable, but interest earned can incentivize users to maintain deposits and contribute to system stability.
* **User Story 5:** I can initiate the redemption of accrued interest and receive it in Dai.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has accrued interest and sufficient balance in the vault.
    * **Post-conditions:** The interest amount is converted to Dai and deposited into the user's wallet. The redeemed interest is deducted from the accrued interest balance.
    * **Accounting:** The redemption transaction and updated interest balance are recorded in the system's accounting ledger.
    * **Risk:** Not directly applicable, but timely redemption of interest can help users manage their financial positions.

**Monitor and manage my collateral and debt position:**

* **User Story 6:** I can view the real-time value of my deposited collateral in both the original asset and Dai equivalent.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has an active deposit.
    * **Post-conditions:** The user interface displays the current market value of the deposited asset and its corresponding value in Dai based on the current exchange rate.
    * **Accounting:** No direct impact on accounting, but asset values are used for calculations.
    * **Risk:** Fluctuations in asset prices can impact the LTV ratio and potential liquidation risk.
* **User Story 7:** I can receive alerts or notifications when my LTV ratio approaches a critical threshold.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has set a preferred LTV threshold.
    * **Post-conditions:** The system monitors the LTV ratio and sends alerts to the user when it nears the set threshold.
    * **Accounting:** No direct impact on accounting, but LTV ratio is calculated based on asset values and debt position.
    * **Risk:** This helps users take timely action to avoid liquidation by adding more collateral or repaying part of the debt.
* **User Story 8:** I can withdraw my deposited collateral, but only if my debt is fully repaid and the LTV ratio meets the minimum requirement.
    * **Pre-conditions:** User has no outstanding debt and meets the minimum LTV requirement.
    * **Post-conditions:** The deposited asset is transferred back to the user's wallet, and the corresponding amount of Dai is burned.
    * **Accounting:** The withdrawal transaction and updated collateral and debt balances are recorded in the system's accounting ledger.
    * **Risk:** Ensures that collateral


## Mathematical Formulas in Depositor User Stories:

**Depositing Collateral:**

* **Dai minted:** Dai_minted = Deposit_amount * Exchange_rate
* **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio:** LTV = (Total debt) / (Total collateral value)
    * Total debt = Initial debt + Stability fee * Time
    * Total collateral value = Deposit_amount * Asset_price

**Redeeming Interest:**

* **Accrued interest:** Interest = Deposit_amount * Stability fee * Time
* **Interest redeemed in Dai:** Interest_Dai = Interest * Exchange_rate

**Monitoring Collateral and Debt:**

* **Collateral value in Dai:** Collateral_Dai = Deposit_amount * Asset_price
* **Minimum LTV requirement:** Minimum_LTV = System-defined minimum threshold

**Additional Formulas:**

* **Liquidation price:** Liquidation_price = Debt / (Collateral_value * Minimum_LTV)
* **Stability fee:** Stability fee = System-defined fee rate

**Important Notes:**

* These formulas represent simplified versions and may not capture all the nuances of the MakerDAO system.
* Actual calculations might involve additional factors and complexities based on specific situations and risk parameters.
* The exchange rate and asset prices are dynamic and constantly fluctuate, impacting calculations in real-time.

## Solidity and Economic Attack Vectors for Depositor User Stories:

**Depositing Collateral:**

**Story 1 & 2:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Reentrancy vulnerability in the smart contract could allow attackers to steal deposited assets during the transfer or minting process.
    * Incorrect exchange rate oracle data could lead to users depositing less collateral than intended for the minted Dai.
* **Economic:**
    * Flash loan attacks could exploit temporary price fluctuations to manipulate exchange rates and steal deposited assets or minted Dai.
    * Malicious actors could manipulate oracle data to artificially inflate asset prices, leading to over-collateralization and potential losses for depositors when prices correct.

**Story 3:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Inaccurate or manipulated exchange rate data could mislead users about the true value of their deposits and Dai.
* **Economic:**
    * None directly applicable.

**Redeeming Interest:**

**Story 4 & 5:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Bugs or vulnerabilities in the interest calculation or redemption logic could allow attackers to steal accrued interest or manipulate redemption amounts.
* **Economic:**
    * Denial-of-service attacks could prevent users from redeeming their interest, potentially leading to losses if the stability fee increases.

**Monitoring Collateral and Debt:**

**Story 6:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Inaccurate or manipulated asset price data could lead to incorrect displays of collateral value and mislead users about their LTV ratio.
* **Economic:**
    * None directly applicable.

**Story 7:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Bugs in the LTV calculation or notification system could lead to inaccurate or delayed alerts, putting deposits at risk of liquidation.
* **Economic:**
    * None directly applicable.

**Story 8:**

* **Solidity:**
    * Reentrancy vulnerabilities could allow attackers to steal withdrawn collateral or manipulate the debt repayment process.
* **Economic:**
    * Price oracles could be manipulated to artificially deflate asset prices, triggering unnecessary liquidations and causing losses for depositors.

**Additional Notes:**

* This list is not exhaustive, and new attack vectors may emerge as the MakerDAO system evolves.
* The severity and feasibility of each attack vector depend on various factors like the specific implementation details, code security audits, and overall system resilience.
* It's crucial for MakerDAO to continuously improve its smart contract security, conduct thorough audits, and implement robust economic mechanisms to mitigate these potential risks.
