# MERKLE TREE

**1. User Roles:**

* **Verifier:** An entity responsible for verifying the inclusion of a transaction in the Merkle tree.
    * **Persona:** Developers, security teams, or any entity needing to verify the authenticity of a transaction within the Merkle tree.
    * **User Journey:**
        1. Receives a transaction data (leaf) and its corresponding Merkle proof.
        2. Obtains the Merkle root of the tree.
        3. Uses the `verify` function with the provided data to check the transaction's inclusion.
        4. Interprets the result (True/False) based on the verification.

**2. User Stories:**

**2.1 Verifier:**

**2.1.1 Verify Transaction:**

* **Pre-state:**
    * Verifier has the transaction data (leaf).
    * Verifier knows the Merkle root.
    * Verifier has a Merkle proof for the transaction.
    * `index` of the transaction in the Merkle tree is provided.
* **Post-state:**
    * Verifier knows whether the transaction is included in the Merkle tree (True/False).
* **Mathematical Formula:**
    * See previously provided explanation for the `verify` function.

* **Pseudocode (Haskell):**
```haskell
verify :: [Hash] -> Hash -> Hash -> Int -> Bool
verify proof root leaf index =
    foldr (\proofElement acc ->
        if even index then
            hash (acc, proofElement)
        else
            hash (proofElement, acc)) leaf proof
    == root
```

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The function correctly verifies the inclusion of the transaction based on the Merkle proof and root.
    * The function returns True for a valid proof and False for an invalid proof.

**2.2 Get Merkle Root:**

* **Pre-state:** N/A
* **Post-state:**
    * Verifier obtains the Merkle root of the tree.
* **Mathematical Formula:** N/A (direct access to stored variable)
* **Pseudocode (Haskell):**
```haskell
getRoot :: Contract -> Hash
getRoot contract = hashes contract !! (length (hashes contract) - 1)
```
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The function returns the correct Merkle root of the tree stored in the `hashes` variable.

**3. Vulnerabilities:**

* **Access Control:** The contract lacks access control mechanisms. Anyone can call the `verify` and `getRoot` functions, which might be undesirable in production.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a simplified example contract for demonstration purposes. Real-world use cases might involve more complex Merkle tree structures and additional functionalities.
* Please provide the context and purpose of the smart contract for a more tailored document.
