## Business Requirements for Factory Contract

**1. User Roles:**

* **Deployer:** Entity deploying the Factory contract.

**2. User Stories:**

**2.1 Deployer:**

**2.1.1 Deploy Factory Contract:**

* **Pre-state:** N/A
* **Post-state:**
    * Factory contract deployed successfully on the blockchain.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Contract deployment succeeds without errors.

**2.1.2 Create New Contract:**

* **Pre-state:**
    * Deployer has access to the `deploy` function of the Factory contract.
* **Post-state:**
    * A new contract is created and deployed on the blockchain.
    * The new contract always returns 42 when its `getMeaningOfLife` function is called (despite the misleading name).
    * The address of the newly deployed contract is emitted in the `Log` event.
* **Mathematical Formula:**
    * `create(value, offset, size)` opcode is used to dynamically deploy a new contract from the provided bytecode.
* **Pseudocode:**
    ```python
    function deploy():
        bytecode = 0x69602a60005260206000f3600052600a6016f3  # bytecode to deploy
        new_address = create(0, bytecode + 0x20, 0x13)  # create new contract
        emit Log(new_address)
    ```
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * New contract is deployed successfully with the provided bytecode.
    * `Log` event emits the address of the new contract.
    * Calling the `getMeaningOfLife` function on the new contract returns 42.

**3. Vulnerabilities:**

* The bytecode used to deploy the new contract is hardcoded and not user-defined. This limits the flexibility of the Factory contract and could potentially restrict its use.
* The deployed contract's functionality is not explicitly documented or verifiable. The misleading name `getMeaningOfLife` could be confusing and lead to unexpected behavior.

**4. Additional Notes:**

* This is a simplified example contract for demonstration purposes. Real-world use cases might involve more complex bytecode generation and deployment scenarios.
* It's important to consider the security implications of deploying arbitrary bytecode using the `create` opcode.

I hope this document provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the Factory contract's functionalities and requirements. Feel free to ask any further questions you might have.
