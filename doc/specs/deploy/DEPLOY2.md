This code showcases a simplified deployment and interaction mechanism using a proxy contract. Let's break down the key components:

**Contracts:**

* **Proxy:** This contract facilitates deployment and interaction with other contracts.
    * `deploy` function receives bytecode and deploys a new contract with that code.
    * `execute` function sends a transaction with data to an existing contract.
* **TestContract1:** Simple contract with an owner and a `setOwner` function.
* **TestContract2:** More complex contract with owner, constructor arguments, and storage variables.
* **Helper:** Utility contract for generating bytecode and calldata.

**Functionalities:**

* **Deployment:**
    * `Proxy.deploy`: Takes bytecode as input and deploys a new contract.
    * `Helper.getBytecode1/2`: Generates bytecode for `TestContract1/2`.
    * Example usage: `Proxy.deploy(Helper.getBytecode2(10, 20))` deploys a `TestContract2` with `x=10` and `y=20`.
* **Interaction:**
    * `Proxy.execute`: Sends a transaction with data to an existing contract.
    * `Helper.getCalldata`: Generates calldata for `TestContract1.setOwner` function.
    * Example usage: `Proxy.execute(deployedTestContract1, Helper.getCalldata(newOwnerAddress))` changes owner of `TestContract1`.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a simplified example and lacks features like access control.
* Deploying arbitrary bytecode can be risky, ensure proper validation and security measures.
* Consider using gas optimization techniques for real-world deployments.
