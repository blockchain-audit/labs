Token Management System Business Requirements
=============================================

Overview
--------

The Token Management System is a modern and gas-efficient ERC20 + EIP-2612 implementation written in Solidity. It provides a reliable and secure framework for managing tokens, allowing users to transfer, approve, and interact with tokens efficiently. The system adheres to the ERC20 standard and incorporates the EIP-2612 permit functionality for streamlined approvals.

User Stories
------------

### As a Token Holder

1.  Transfer Tokens

    -   Description: As a token holder, I want to be able to transfer my tokens to another address.
    -   Acceptance Criteria:
        -   The system should deduct the specified amount from my balance.
        -   The recipient's balance should be updated with the transferred amount.
        -   The system should emit a Transfer event.
2.  Approve Token Spending

    -   Description: As a token holder, I want to grant approval to another address to spend a specific amount of tokens on my behalf.
    -   Acceptance Criteria:
        -   The approval amount should be recorded in the system.
        -   The system should emit an Approval event.
3.  Transfer Tokens with Approval

    -   Description: As a token holder, I want to transfer tokens on behalf of another address that has granted me approval.
    -   Acceptance Criteria:
        -   The system should deduct the approved amount from the spender's allowance.
        -   The spender's balance should be updated with the transferred amount.
        -   The owner's allowance should be reduced by the transferred amount.
        -   The system should emit a Transfer event.

### As a Token Holder with EIP-2612 Permit

1.  Grant Permit for Token Spending

    -   Description: As a token holder, I want to grant approval for another address to spend a specific amount of tokens with an EIP-2612 permit.
    -   Acceptance Criteria:
        -   The permit should be validated based on the EIP-2612 standard.
        -   The approved amount should be recorded in the system.
        -   The system should emit an Approval event.
2.  Transfer Tokens with EIP-2612 Permit

    -   Description: As a token holder, I want to transfer tokens using an EIP-2612 permit, allowing another address to spend on my behalf.
    -   Acceptance Criteria:
        -   The permit should be validated based on the EIP-2612 standard.
        -   The approved amount should be deducted from the spender's allowance.
        -   The spender's balance should be updated with the transferred amount.
        -   The owner's allowance should be reduced by the transferred amount.
        -   The system should emit a Transfer event.

Technical Details
-----------------

### ERC20 Standard

-   The system adheres to the ERC20 standard for token management.
-   Balances are managed using the `balanceOf` mapping.
-   Allowances for spending are recorded in the `allowance` mapping.

### EIP-2612 Permit

-   The system supports the EIP-2612 permit functionality for streamlined approvals.
-   Users can grant permits for spending tokens without the need for multiple transactions.

Conclusion
----------

The Token Management System provides a robust and efficient solution for token holders, ensuring secure and gas-efficient token transfers and approvals. The integration of the EIP-2612 permit functionality enhances user experience by simplifying the approval process.
