## Wallet1 with Interesting Features: Agile User Stories

Based on the original Wallet1 contract, here are user stories incorporating some interesting features:

**User Roles:**

* **Owner:** Deployer with full control over the wallet.
* **Delegate:** Authorized by the owner to perform specific actions (e.g., withdrawals up to a certain limit).
* **Guardian:** Can initiate a recovery process in case the owner loses access.

**User Stories:**

**1. As the Owner, I want to delegate specific withdrawal permissions to another address.**

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The owner can add a delegate address with a defined spending limit.
    * The delegate can withdraw funds within the limit without the owner's approval.
    * Attempts to withdraw exceeding the limit or from non-delegated addresses fail.

**2. As the Owner, I want to set up a guardian for emergency access recovery.**

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The owner can specify a guardian address.
    * If the owner loses their private key, they can initiate a recovery process requiring the guardian's approval.
    * The guardian can approve the recovery, transferring ownership to a new address chosen by the owner.
    * Security measures in place prevent unauthorized access by the guardian.

**3. As a Delegate, I want to withdraw funds within my authorized limit.**

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The delegate can call the `withdraw` function up to their specified limit.
    * Wallet balance and delegate limit are updated after each withdrawal.
    * Delegate cannot access funds beyond their limit or perform other actions.

**4. As the Guardian, I want to help the owner recover access with proper safeguards.**

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The guardian can only participate in recovery if the owner initiates the process.
    * The guardian's approval triggers a time-locked transfer of ownership to a new address.
    * Multiple approvals might be required from additional guardians for enhanced security.

**5. As a potential user, I want to understand the security features and trade-offs.**

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Clear documentation explains the delegation, recovery process, and security implications.
    * Users are informed of the potential risks and benefits of these features compared to a basic wallet.
    * Best practices for secure key management and guardian selection are highlighted.

**Additional Notes:**

* These user stories introduce multi-signature features and emergency access mechanisms, making the wallet more versatile but also increasing complexity.
* Thorough security audits and testing are crucial for these features to function securely.
* Consider adding transaction history tracking and integration with decentralized exchanges for further enhancements.
