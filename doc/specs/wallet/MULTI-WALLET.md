Business Requirements Documentation
1. User Roles
Definition
Owners: Users who have the authority to submit, confirm, execute, and revoke transactions within the MultiSigWallet contract.
User Journey and Persona
User Journey:
Owners deploy the MultiSigWallet contract, specifying the required number of confirmations.
Owners can deposit funds into the contract.
Owners can submit transactions to transfer funds to specified addresses.
Other owners confirm submitted transactions.
Once the required number of confirmations is reached, owners can execute the transaction.
Owners can revoke their confirmation on a pending transaction if necessary.
2. User Stories
User Story 1: Submit Transaction
System Pre-State Description: The system is in a state where no transactions are pending.
System Post-State Description: After submission, a new transaction is added to the list of pending transactions.
Mathematical Formulas:
N/A
System Post-State Description with Variable Changes:
New transaction added to the transactions array.
Acceptance Criteria:
Transaction should be added to the list of pending transactions.
Event SubmitTransaction should emit with correct parameters.
User Story 2: Confirm Transaction
System Pre-State Description: The system has a pending transaction that needs confirmation.
System Post-State Description: After confirmation, the number of confirmations for the transaction increases.
Mathematical Formulas:
N/A
System Post-State Description with Variable Changes:
Number of confirmations for the transaction increases by 1.
Acceptance Criteria:
Number of confirmations for the transaction should increase.
Event ConfirmTransaction should emit with correct parameters.
User Story 3: Execute Transaction
System Pre-State Description: The system has a pending transaction with the required number of confirmations.
System Post-State Description: After execution, the transaction is marked as executed, and funds are transferred.
Mathematical Formulas:
N/A
System Post-State Description with Variable Changes:
Transaction status is updated to executed.
Acceptance Criteria:
Transaction status should be updated to executed.
Funds should be successfully transferred to the specified address.
Event ExecuteTransaction should emit with correct parameters.
User Story 4: Revoke Confirmation
System Pre-State Description: The system has a pending transaction that the user has already confirmed.
System Post-State Description: After revoking confirmation, the number of confirmations for the transaction decreases.
Mathematical Formulas:
N/A
System Post-State Description with Variable Changes:
Number of confirmations for the transaction decreases by 1.
Acceptance Criteria:
Number of confirmations for the transaction should decrease.
Event RevokeConfirmation should emit with correct parameters.
3. Vulnerabilities
Unchecked Transaction Value: There's no validation to ensure that the transaction value doesn't exceed the contract's balance.
Potential Reentrancy Attack: The executeTransaction function executes external calls before updating internal state variables, leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
Unused Functionality: The contract includes a receive() function that can accept Ether transfers but doesn't enforce any specific logic related to the MultiSig functionality, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
Limited Error Handling: While certain functions include require statements for basic validations, more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms are lacking, leaving the contract vulnerable to unexpected conditions and edge cases.
