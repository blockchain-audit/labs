Here is a comprehensive list of formal logic concepts and syntax used in Dafny:

### Quantifiers:

- Universal Quantifier (∀): Represented by the keyword `forall`. It expresses that a certain condition holds for all values of a given variable.
- Existential Quantifier (∃): Represented by the keyword `exists`. It expresses that there exists at least one value of a given variable that satisfies a certain condition.

### Logical Connectives:

- Logical AND (∧): Represented by the symbol &&. It connects two Boolean expressions and evaluates to true if both expressions are true.
- Logical OR (∨): Represented by the symbol ||. It connects two Boolean expressions and evaluates to true if at least one of the expressions is true.
- Logical NOT (¬): Represented by the symbol !. It negates a Boolean expression, flipping its truth value.

### Implication and Equivalence:

- Implication (⇒): Represented by the symbol ==>. It expresses that if a certain condition is true, then another condition must also be true.
- Equivalence (⇔): Represented by the symbol <==>. It expresses that two conditions are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value in all cases.

### Comparison Operators:

- Equality (==): Compares if two expressions are equal.
- Inequality (!=): Compares if two expressions are not equal.
- Less than (<), Less than or equal to (<=): Compares if one expression is less than or less than or equal to another expression.
- Greater than (>), Greater than or equal to (>=): Compares if one expression is greater than or greater than or equal to another expression.

### Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulo (%): Perform arithmetic operations on numerical expressions.
Set Operators:

- Set Membership (∈): Represented by the symbol `in`. It checks if an element belongs to a set.
- Set Equality (==): Compares if two sets are equal.

### Miscellaneous:

Boolean Constants: `true` and `false` represent the Boolean values true and false, respectively.
Parentheses: Used to group expressions and specify the order of evaluation.
