```dafny
method exec3(x: int) returns (y: int)
requires 10 <= x
ensures  20 <= y  {             // 10 <= x
    var a := x + 3;             // 10 <= x && a = x + 3
    var b := 12;                // 10 <= x && a = x + 3 && b = 12
    y := a + b;                 // 10 <= x && a = x + 3 && b = 12 && y = a + b
}                               // 10 <= x && a = x + 3 && b = 12 && y = a + b ==> 20 <= y
```



I'll provide a rigorous argument that the formula 10 <= x && a = x + 3 && b = 12 && y = a + b ==> 25 <= y is valid,
incorporating mathematical reasoning and addressing potential ambiguities:

1. Premise Breakdown:

10 <= x: This establishes a lower bound for the value of x.
a = x + 3: This defines the value of a in relation to x, ensuring a is always 3 more than x.
b = 12: This assigns a constant value of 12 to b.
y = a + b: This sets y as the sum of a and b.

2. Substitution and Simplification:

Substituting a's definition (a = x + 3) into y's equation (y = a + b) yields: y = (x + 3) + 12.
Simplifying: y = x + 15.

3. Leveraging the Premise:

We know from the premise that 10 <= x.
Adding 15 to both sides of the inequality preserves its validity: 10 + 15 <= x + 15.
Simplifying: 25 <= x + 15.

4. Establishing the Conclusion:

Recall that y = x + 15.
Therefore, substituting y into the inequality derived in step 3 results in: 25 <= y.

5. Conclusion:

The formula 10 <= x && a = x + 3 && b = 12 && y = a + b ==> 25 <= y is indeed valid.
Key Points:

The argument relies on valid mathematical operations and logical reasoning.
It demonstrates that the conclusion (25 <= y) necessarily follows from the given premises.
This approach clarifies the relationship between variables and establishes the formula's validity.



## Floyd Logic - [from pos-state to pre-state]

```
 25 <= y
 25 <= a + b
 25 <= (x + 3) + 12
 25 <= x + 15
 10 <= x ==> 25 <= x + 15
```

1. Assume the Antecedent (assum 10 <= x)
In order to evaluate the implication, we assume the antecedent (10 <= x) is true

2. Manipulate the Expression
The formula 25 <= x + 15 can be simplified by subtracting 15 from both sides:

25 <= x + 15
10 <= x

This step shows that the formulat 10 <= x is a necessary condition for 25 <= x + 15 to hold true

3. Implication holds

Since the antecedent (10 <= x) is assumed to be true, and the manipulation of the expression
demonstrates that 25 <= x + 15 holds when 10 <= x, the implication 10 <= x ==> 25 <= x + 15
is valid.

4. Conclusion

Therefore, based on the assumption of the antecedent and the manipulation of the expressions, we can
conclude that 10 <= x ==> 25 <= x + 15 is indeed a valid logical statement.

In simpler terms, if x is greater that or equal to 10, the x + 15 will be greater than or equal to 25,
and the formula holds true


So 25 <= x + 15 is equal 10 <= x, so it will arrive to the implication 10 <= x ==> 10 <= 10, that is a simpler way to prove that 10 <= x ==> 25 <= x + 15. If this is correct, why you didn't show this prove instead ?
You are absolutely correct, and I appreciate your clarification. I apologize for any confusion caused by the more detailed explanation.

As you correctly pointed out, 25 <= x + 15 is indeed equivalent to 10 <= x, and the implication 10 <= x ==> 25 <= x + 15 can be more simply stated as 10 <= x ==> 10<= 10, which is a tautology and always true.



## Hoare Triples


### {{ x == 12 }} x = x + 8 {{ x == 20 }}

If the program x = x + 8 started in a state where x is 12, then the program is guraranteed to terminate in a state where x has the value 20, so this Hoare triple holds [is valid].


```
{Precondition}         {Given: x == 12}

x = x + 8              {Execution of the statement}

{Postcondition}        {To prove: x == 20}

x + 8 == 20            {Substitute the updated value into the postcondition}

x == 12                {Simplify and solve for x}

{Postcondition}        {The Hoare triple is valid}
```

### {{ x < 18 }} S {{ 0 <= y }}

The program [S] can be:

* y = 5
* y = 18 - x

The program [S] can't be:

* y = x
* y = 2 * (x + 3)

The program starts in a state satisfying predicate P is guraranteed to be creash-free when termitate in a state satisfying the predicate Q.

```dafny


method hoare2(x: int) returns (y: int)
requires x < 18
ensures  0 <= y {
    var a := 13;
    var b := 22;

    if (x > a && x > 0) {
        y := 99 + x;
    } else {
        y := b + 2;
    }
}
```
