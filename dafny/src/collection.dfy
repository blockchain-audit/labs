// This defines a set in a manner reminiscent of a universal quantifier
// (forall). As with quantifiers, the type can usually be inferred.
// In contrast to quantifiers, the bar syntax (|) is required to separate
// the predicate (p) from the bound variable (x). The type of the elements
// of the resulting set is the type of the return value of f(x).
// The values in the constructed set are the return values of f(x): x
// itself acts only as a bridge between the predicate p and the function f.
// It usually has the same type as the resulting set, but it does not need to.
