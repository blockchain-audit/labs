The Task:
only 3 gabaim
compare the gas cost with loop and without loop, avoid loops
the source code must be in the src/wallet folder
add the other .sol files into a folder, in a way that the src has only its folder
install the audit plugin here or another solidty vscode extension in order to see solidity code with colors
when you finish, update the column T2-SOL in our sheet file, with 1 when you finished
give a thumb here also
