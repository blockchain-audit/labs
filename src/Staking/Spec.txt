Example:
Reuven deposits a token in type-MyToken.
Reuven can always deposit, every day and every hour
On the day Reuven wants to withdraw the money, a check will be made- to see if he can receive a bonus.

Calculation of the test:

Every person who deposits a token-
the amount goes into a pool.
The bonus is received according to the ratio between the amount of 
deposits that were in the pool minimum 7 days to the current balance in the pool.

Reuven receives:
1. The amount he withdrew from how much he deposited in the deposit pool.
2. If the depositor's amount meets the calculation and he needs to receive a bonus, 
he gets it from the big pool - the bonus pool.
3. The percentage he will receive from the large pool is not from the entire pool 
but from 10 percent of the pool so that it remains for additional investors
